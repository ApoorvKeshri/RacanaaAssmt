http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload" and uploading a file:

Set up the environment:

Download and install the required browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver).
Set the path to the browser driver executable in your code.
Create a new instance of the WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver).

Navigate to the URL "http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload" using the WebDriver.

Locate the file upload input field using appropriate WebDriver locator methods (e.g., findElement with By.id).

Provide the file path of the file to be uploaded by sending the file path to the file upload input field using the sendKeys method.

Locate the upload button using appropriate WebDriver locator methods.

Click the upload button using the click method.

Implement a wait mechanism to wait for the upload process to complete. You can use explicit waits to wait for specific elements or conditions on the page.

Verify if the file is uploaded successfully:

Locate the element that displays the uploaded file name (e.g., <div id="uploaded-files">).
Retrieve the text of the element using appropriate WebDriver methods (e.g., getText).
Compare the uploaded file name with the expected file name.
Print a message indicating whether the file upload was successful or not.
Close the browser using the quit method of the WebDriver.
